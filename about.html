<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
    Hi. Thanks for visiting my site! I'm in my 20's and currently working in incident response at a large enterprise.
    I'm from the middle of America - Kansas City, MO - and I graduated from the University of Missouri at Columbia
    (heretofore referred to as Mizzou) in 2015 with a degree in Information Technology.
</p>
<p>
    I'd just like to start off by saying I love what I do.
    In and out of my job, I primarily develop Python and PowerShell scripts for collecting and analyzing
    data and making sense of "threat intelligence" to help the rest of my team figure out where to look when certain threats appear.
</p>
<p>
    A lot of my recent focus has been on bringing disparate security products together with Python, and with analyzing workstation logs
    with PowerShell. I'll typically spend 30 minutes to an hour a week diving into the Windows Event Log data on my local computer to try
    and identify new and interesting logs that the infosec community can use.
</p>
