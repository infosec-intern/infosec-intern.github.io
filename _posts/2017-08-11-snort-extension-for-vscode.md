I recently released another extension for VSCode: `Snort`

It's another language colorizer, similar to my last one, but for Snort IDS rules. You can see the specifics online at [the Visual Studio Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=infosec-intern.snort), and the source code [on GitHub](https://github.com/infosec-intern/textmate-snort).
Here's a screenshot for reference:
