# A Note on MalwareTech

## TL;DR
I think MalwareTech is innocent based on his past research, the wide-spread practice of stealing public code, and the lack of clear evidence supporting the FBI's assertions.

## Introduction
This last week, [we saw one of the most widely-known researchers](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/08/security-researcher-who-neutralized-wcry-to-be-released-on-30000-bond/) in our community, MalwareTech, arrested and charged with developing, distributing, and using malicious software. Obviously, I'm no lawyer. I will try not to spend much time talking about the actual legal assertions and/or consequences of the case, but, like everyone else with a Twitter account, this post will inevitably lead down that path. This is just a fair warning if you're not in the mood to read a layman's opinions on a (most likely) complex legal case. In addition, I clearly have my biases in favor of MalwareTech. I've been following his blog since his _Reversing Dridex_ series, and he seems like an incredibly smart, talented, and ethical researcher.

## Overview
Some of the most common points I've seen surrounding this incident are:

* Why didn't law enforcement arrest MalwareTech as soon as he got in the country instead of after DEFCON?
* Did MalwareTech have a hand in writing/distributing WannaCry as well since he benefited from it so much?
* What evidence does the FBI have against MalwareTech?
* Assuming MalwareTech is innocent, how could the FBI's assertions line up with MalwareTech's activities?

### Law Enforcement's Timing
##### Why didn't law enforcement arrest MalwareTech as soon as he got in the country instead of after DEFCON?
I've seen some people asking why MalwareTech wasn't arrested far earlier in the week; before he "spent lavishly in Vegas" during DEFCON. I think the primary reason is to keep the story quieter.
He would've been the talk of DEFCON had he been arrested before or during it, and it gave the prosecutors more time to question him before an uproar began. All in all, it doesn't really matter when law enforcement arrested him. The most it would've changed is how quickly people heard the story.
