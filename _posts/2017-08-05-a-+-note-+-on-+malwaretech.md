# A Note on MalwareTech

## TL;DR
I think MalwareTech is innocent based on his past research, the wide-spread practice of stealing public code, and the lack of clear evidence supporting the FBI's assertions.

## Introduction
This last week, [we saw one of the most widely-known researchers](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/08/security-researcher-who-neutralized-wcry-to-be-released-on-30000-bond/) in our community, MalwareTech, arrested and charged with developing, distributing, and using malicious software. Obviously, I'm no lawyer. I will try not to spend much time talking about the actual legal assertions and/or consequences of the case, but, like everyone else with a Twitter account, this post will inevitably lead down that path. This is just a fair warning if you're not in the mood to read a layman's opinions on a (most likely) complex legal case. In addition, I clearly have my biases in favor of MalwareTech. I've been following his blog since his _Reversing Dridex_ series, and he seems like an incredibly smart, talented, and ethical researcher.

## Overview
Some of the most common points I've seen surrounding this incident are:

* Why didn't law enforcement arrest MalwareTech as soon as he got in the country instead of after DEFCON?
* Did MalwareTech have a hand in writing/distributing WannaCry as well since he benefited from it so much?
* What evidence does the FBI have against MalwareTech?
* Assuming MalwareTech is innocent, how could the FBI's assertions line up with MalwareTech's activities?

### Law Enforcement's Timing
##### Why didn't law enforcement arrest MalwareTech as soon as he got in the country instead of after DEFCON?
I've seen some people asking why MalwareTech wasn't arrested far earlier in the week; before he "spent lavishly in Vegas" during DEFCON. I think the primary reason is to keep the story quieter.
He would've been the talk of DEFCON had he been arrested before or during it, and it gave the prosecutors more time to question him before an uproar began. All in all, it doesn't really matter when law enforcement arrested him. The most it would've changed is how quickly people heard the story.

### MalwareTech and WannaCry
##### Did MalwareTech have a hand in writing/distributing WannaCry as well since he benefited from it so much?
This is a ridiculous leap in logic. Do all security vendors who benefitted from WannaCry (Symantec, FireEye, Cylance, etc.) automatically have a hand in its development? No.
Unfortunately, this idea jumped from Twitter as a decidedly dark conspiracy that I had the pleasure of [seeing firsthand](https://twitter.com/infosec_intern/status/863206075088154624), to well-known researchers [reconsidering](https://cybersecpolitics.blogspot.com/2017/08/the-killswitch-story-feels-like-bullshit.html) MalwareTech's story about finding the killswitch and stopping WannaCry. In the above article, no evidence was given, and the obvious retort is that MalwareTech's been doing this as a hobby (and now as a career) for many years.
Reversing malware, finding un-registered domains, and registering them as his own to monitor traffic. His [Botnet Tracker](https://intel.malwaretech.com/) has been up for a while at this point. His work [tracking P2P botnets](https://www.malwaretech.com/2016/01/exploring-peer-to-peer-botnets.html) is the key here, as he began registering domains he found to keep up with these botnets and help populate his map. From the link:
```
 In order to map all workers, weâ€™d need to set up multiple supernodes across the botnet which log incoming connections
```
We can see more of his motives further down in the article:
```
If we know the IP addresses of all the workers on the botnet, we can proactively work against any malicious actions they might take: for instance, if the botnet was a spam botnet, we could have have all the IP addresses flagged for spam before they even send a single email
```
Now, given his activities, and how he publicly posted about them, why would he sabotage these huge botnets by sharing lists of infected bots with the world? That's a question I've seen few answers to.

In addition, the FBI's accusations have nothing to do with WannaCry. Let's say he did knowingly create and distribute the Kronos malware a few years ago; that is still no reason to doubt MalwareTech's actions and intentions during the WannaCry incident.

### Evidence Against MalwareTech
##### What evidence does the FBI have against MalwareTech?
Hm. This one's tough. I've seen the same information released that everyone else has, so, in short, I have no idea what evidence there is.
Smarter people than I pointed out very quickly that the FBI accused MalwareTech of selling Kronos on AlphaBay only a few weeks after publicly announcing they took control of the site. I think it's a fair assumption to say the AlphaBay seizure gave the FBI whatever evidence they have against MalwareTech.
Other than that assumption, everything else is too early to draw any conclusions. I clearly have my biases for MalwareTech, but even I'll admit it's *possible* he helped write and sell some malware. Right now though, all we have are assertions without evidence, which means innocent.

### MalwareTech's Innocence
##### Assuming MalwareTech is innocent, how could the FBI's assertions line up with MalwareTech's activities?
After a few more days of cooling off from this story, I've decided not to write this section up. It would pretty much boil down to more assumptions about the FBI (mostly negative) and about MalwareTech (mostly positive) without a basis in stark facts. I'll add updates as the story progresses.
