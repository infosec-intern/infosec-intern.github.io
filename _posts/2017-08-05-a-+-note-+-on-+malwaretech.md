# A Note on MalwareTech

## TL;DR
I think MalwareTech is innocent based on his past research, the wide-spread practice of stealing public code, and the lack of clear evidence supporting the FBI's assertions.

## Introduction
This last week, [we saw one of the most widely-known researchers](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/08/security-researcher-who-neutralized-wcry-to-be-released-on-30000-bond/) in our community, MalwareTech, arrested and charged with developing, distributing, and using malicious software. Obviously, I'm no lawyer. I will try not to spend much time talking about the actual legal assertions and/or consequences of the case, but, like everyone else with a Twitter account, this post will inevitably lead down that path. This is just a fair warning if you're not in the mood to read a layman's opinions on a (most likely) complex legal case. In addition, I clearly have my biases in favor of MalwareTech. I've been following his blog since his _Reversing Dridex_ series, and he seems like an incredibly smart, talented, and ethical researcher.

## Overview
Some of the most common points I've seen surrounding this incident are:

* Why didn't law enforcement arrest MalwareTech as soon as he got in the country instead of after DEFCON?
* Did MalwareTech have a hand in writing/distributing WannaCry as well since he benefited from it so much?
* What evidence does the FBI have against MalwareTech?
* Assuming MalwareTech is innocent, how could the FBI's assertions line up with MalwareTech's activities?
