I love Linux, but it has never been good at a few things:

1. Gaming
2. Going to sleep (or more accurately waking up)
3. Marketing

I'll be ignoring points 1 and 3 and focusing on point 2 - troubleshooting waking up a Linux machine. I have a desktop with Arch Linux and kernel 4.12, and every time my desktop puts itself to sleep I have to reboot it just to use it again.
This is because - for one reason or another - my HID devices (mouse and keyboard) stop working, and it's one of the most frustrating problems I've had to deal with in the 4 or so years I've been regularly using Linux.
