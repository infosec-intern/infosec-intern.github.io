As you can see, it's still very much under construction, but this blog is one of my primary projects right now.
I've never worked with Jekyll before, but have a bit of experience using Flask + Jinja2 templates, so Jekyll's Liquid tags system is mostly familiar. Plus, having some Git experience (read as: I know the main 4 git commands) is a boon.

So far I've been really impressed with the system GitHub has set up. There are some things about Jekyll I don't like (how hard is it to include block tags like Jinja has?), but GitHub has made it really simple to host the site, update it, and customize the non-HTML parts like DNS and extra content delivery.
