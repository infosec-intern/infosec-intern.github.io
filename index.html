<h1>Hi there, I'm Thomas Gardner!</h1>
<p id="introduction">
    a.k.a Infosec Intern. This site was created with the help of
    <a href="http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/">Hank Quinlan's GitHub Pages tutorial</a>
</p>
<p>
    This site is focused on information security topics, including any projects I've worked on,
    questions I've come up with (probably heavily focused around Arch Linux - that thing can be a beast to work with sometimes),
    and just general musings or interesting article posts. Soon, I'd like to do more CTF writeups and malware analysis writeups,
    but I'm admittedly such a novice at each of those that I'm hesitant to post them.
